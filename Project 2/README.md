# Memory Game Project

Welcome to my Memory Game. 
To play simply click on any of the facedown cards
And aim to match this card to another card using your
Memory. Try and improve each time to improve your 
High scores. When you have matched all 16 cards, 
You will see a pop-up window with your scores, 
Click on the 'try again button' if you want to play again. 
At any point you can click on the restart button to 
Shuffle the cards and refresh all scores. 

You can expect to have a great time enjoying the game, 
All while improving your memory. 

Good luck and have fun.
