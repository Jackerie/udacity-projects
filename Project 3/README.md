#How to play:
To play the game, Use the directional keys on your keyboard, which will move your character one 'square' in any direction.
Your character cannot leave the game board.

To win the game, you need to cross the terrain infront of you and get to the water *without* getting hit by a nasty bug on the way.
You need to press forward once in the water to trigger your victory screen.

If a bug hits you, the game will reset.
If you win the game, and want to play again, press F5.

##What can you expect?

Having a bit of fun, enjoying some old school nostalgia :)
